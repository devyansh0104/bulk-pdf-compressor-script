PDF Compressor: Smart Optimization for Your Documents
This repository contains a simple yet powerful Python script to compress PDF files. It intelligently handles different page types (text and images) and aims to meet a target file size, making it perfect for preparing documents for email, web uploads, or storage.

üöÄ Features
‚úÖ Adaptive Compression
Automatically analyzes each page, preserving the quality of text and vector graphics while aggressively compressing large, image-heavy pages using optimized settings.

‚úÖ Precision Target Sizing
Iteratively adjusts image quality (DPI and JPEG compression) across multiple attempts to get the file size as close as possible to your desired target (in KB).

‚úÖ Batch Processing
Designed to process all PDF files within a designated input folder, making bulk compression a seamless, automated process.

‚úÖ Real-time Feedback
Provides clear, instant feedback on the compression result for every file, including the final file size and any challenges encountered.

3. Configure settings:
Open the compressor_2.py file and modify the following variables to match your setup:

INPUT_FOLDER: The path to the folder containing the PDF files you want to compress.

OUTPUT_FOLDER: The path where the compressed PDFs will be saved.
